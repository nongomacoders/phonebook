instead if a div tag create a contact component for the App file

Very good.

We dont want to have arrays in our components.
The Contact component should receive info for only one contact via props.
The idea is for the component to work with any data source.

Move the array to a separate js file like contactList.js
import it into App.svelte

Use the #each loop inside App.svelte to generate a list of Contact components
You will use props to send info to each Contact component.

When you are confident add the Add, Edit and Delete functionality
